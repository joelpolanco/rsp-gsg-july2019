# Getting Started with Intel® RFID Sensor Platform (RSP)

The instructions in this getting started guide will rapidly get an Intel RSP configuration up and running in your lab to prepare for solution development. The steps in this guide apply whether you provide your own hardware or buy the Intel RSP Developer Kit (RDK)*^^UPDATE NAME WHEN KNOWN^^*, available from the [atlasRFIDstore](https://www.atlasrfidstore.com/intel-rsp-h3000-integrated-rfid-reader-development-kit/).

The Intel RSP gateway software is open source and fully functional, so you can easily build your own solution. The web-based application included in the distribution demonstrates the capabilities of Intel RSP by building on the API to collect and process RFID tag information.

##### *The web portal shown in this guide is not intended to be a complete end-to-end inventory management solution. It is a demonstration of what the platform can do.*

Other than the web portal, all the software pieces installed in this getting started guide, including the MQTT and CLI functionality and the RSP Controller (the gateway application that makes the RSP system work), are core components of the platform.

## System Overview

### Solution Structure

The image below is an example of a robust inventory management system built on Intel RSP. The RSP reader activates the RFID tags within its range and passes tag data, along with information from other on-board sensors, to the RSP Controller gateway software running on a PC. The RSP Controller aggregates the high volume of raw data and generates meaningful inventory events (e.g., "item exited"), alerts, and system status notifications. It publishes them to MQTT topics on an upstream channel, available to applications running in a customer’s cloud infrastructure.

The PC doesn't need to be dedicated to running RSP Controller software. It can also run other workloads and be available for future expansion.

### Network Map for Getting Started
This getting started tutorial uses a simple network configuration, shown in the image below. Key points about the setup:

 - RSP sensor units are powered by a PoE+ switch and get their IP address from a DHCP-enabled router that the switch is connected to.
 - RSP Controller gateway software runs on a PC, which must be on the same network segment.
 - RSP Controller software automatically pairs with the RSP sensors. 
 - A simple command-line interface on the RSP Controller PC enables troubleshooting and low-level data monitoring.
 - (Demo only, not meant for production) A web-based portal displays data gathered by the RSP Controller software over an MQTT channel. The web portal allows you to make configuration changes as well.

## System Requirements
In the items below, *RDK* refers to the Intel RSP Developer Kit. You can buy the kit, or you can provide your own hardware.

### Hardware
 - Any PC that can run the JRE and operating system *(if you have the RDK, an Intel NUC)*
 - Ethernet router with DHCP enabled *(if you have the RDK, model xxx)*
 - Ethernet switch that supports PoE+ *(if you have the RDK, model yyy)*
 - At least one Intel RSP sensor unit, preferably two, from models H1000, H3000, or H4000 *(if you have the RDK, one H1000 and one H3000)*
 - Sample RFID tags to test with
 - Ethernet cables

### Software
 - Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 8 or later *(if you have the RDK, preinstalled)*
 - Any  operating system that can run the JRE *(if you have the RDK, Ubuntu 18.04)*

## Setting up the Hardware

Whether you're using the RSP Developer Kit or provided your own components, the steps for setting up your environment are the same.
1. Power on the router first. 
(Each RSP sensor unit needs a DHCP server when it starts up.)
2. Connect the PoE+ switch to the router and power it on.
3. Connect the router to the internet.
4. Connect each RSP sensor to a PoE+ port on the switch.
5. Connect the RSP Controller PC to the router and power it on.
6. Attach a monitor to the RSP Controller PC and power it on.

## Installing and Running the RSP Controller on Windows

Instructions for build and installation in a Windows environment are in the [RSP Controller Installation & User's Guide](https://github.com/intel/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/blob/master/docs/338088-002_Intel-RSP_User_Guide.pdf), section 2.2.

## Installing the RSP Controller on Linux (Recommended)
This section assumes an Ubuntu 18.04 installation, preinstalled on the RDK, but but other Linux distributions compatible with JRE 8+ should also be compatible.
1. If you have the Intel RSP Developer Kit (RDK), the software is preinstalled. Skip ahead to "[Run RSP Controller software](#run_controller_linux)". 
2. If you provided your own RSP Controller PC, carry out all of the following steps.

### Install prerequisites (not needed for RDK)
1. Run these commands to get software required for building the RSP Controller application.
```
#-- install development dependencies
sudo apt-get install default-jdk git gradle
```
2. Run these commands to get software required for the RSP Controller to communicate. *--((HTML version of the GSG will need to remove the automatic coloring for ssh, which is misleading.))*
```
#-- install runtime dependencies
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients avahi-daemon ntp ssh
```
### Clone RSP Controller repository (not needed for RDK)
1. Run these commands to clone the RSP Controller repository in a new directory. This guide assume you've used the ~/projects directory, but you can change the path to wherever you want to clone the directory where you see the projects directory in later steps.
```
#-- create expected directories for the use case examples and documentation
mkdir -p ~/projects
#-- clone the reference source code
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/intel/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw.git
```

### Build and deploy (not needed for RDK)
These components are preinstalled if you have the RSP Developer Kit. If you don't, go to the Linux PC you're using for the RSP Controller software and follow the steps in tthis section.
1. Run these commands to build the Controller software, using the gradle utility.
```
cd ~/projects/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw

#-- The gradle build script will trigger a full build
#-- and a local deployment to the directory ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw 
gradle clean deploy
```
2. Run these commands to generate certificates for authentication between the RSP Controller and sensors for a secure connection.
```
#-- !!!! CERTIFICATES ARE NEEDED !!!!
#-- The sensors connect securely to the RSP Controller using a self-signed certificate.
#-- A convenience script generates these credentials in order to get the
#-- reference deployment up and running quickly.
mkdir -p ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/cache
cd ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/cache
~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/gen_keys.sh
```

## <a id="run_controller_linux"></a>Running the RSP Controller on Linux
The RSP Controller software must be running in order to gather, process, and report data form RFID tags. You'll build your own solution that communicates with the RSP Controller over MQTT, but the web portal in this section will give you an idea of what kind of data the RSP Controller makes available.

### Start RSP Controller software
A shell script starts the RSP Controller application in the foreground. 
1. Run these commands to start the application: 
```
cd ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw
~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/run.sh
```
The RSP sensors listen for messages from the RSP Controller and initiate a connection with it. As the sensors connect, by default the RSP Controller schedules them to activate in round-robin sequence, one at a time. You can watch the terminal output to see connections taking place and RFID tags being read.

You can run the web portal (next section) at any time after starting the RSP Controller software because the dashboard refreshes automatically. The web portal dashboard will be ready to display RFID data when you see a screen like the following:

![enter image description here](add-screenshot-URL-here)

### Open the web portal
The RSP Controller provides, as sample software, a web-based administration interface for configuration and RFID monitoring. The home page is a dashboard showing connected sensors, tags being read, and other status information.

1. Open the web portal from the RSP Controller PC by going to http://localhost:8080/web-admin/ in a browser.
2. Navigate through the portal by choosing a page from the three-bar menu on the upper left of the display.

![enter image description here](add-screenshot-URL-here)

## Viewing RFID data in other ways
You've now used the RSP web portal to see a sample of some of the platform's capabilities. In this section, you'll use some RSP building blocks of data that you'll use for your own RFID solution:
 - **The MQTT communications protocol.** The RSP Controller uses a built-in MQTT broker to deliver data structured as JSON-RPC. Many libraries support the well-known MQTT and JSON-RPC protocols, so it's straightforward to implement data access in the code for your solution.
 - **The RSP Controller CLI.** The RSP Controller includes a simple, local command-line interface for accessing data and also for making sensor configuration changes. 

### Subscribe to MQTT topics
You can open a terminal window and subscribe to the RSP Controller events topic in order to monitor 
tag events produced by the RSP Controller, raw RFID tag data, and other RSP system information. 

The RSP web portal displays many of the available MQTT topics (specific sets of data you can subscribe to) in the Upstream and Downstream panes of the Dashboard page, e.g., "rfid/gw/alerts". The RSP Controller divides its MQTT topics into two groups:
- Downstream: data the RSP Controller pulls from or sends to the sensors
- Upstream: processed data the RSP Controller makes available out on the network to go into a database, management app, etc.

1. To see RSP data over MQTT from a terminal window:
```
#-- See data from the RSP Controller events topic
mosquitto_sub -t rfid/gw/events
```
The console displays in JSON-RPC format any high-level events processed by the RSP Controller (e.g., an RFID tag has appeared for the first time) while you're monitoring this topic. If you don't see any events initially, try introducing or moving some tags.
![enter image description here](add-screenshot-URL-here)

2. Press Ctrl-C to stop monitoring MQTT data on this topic.
3. Try some of the other MQTT topics to see other types of data the RSP Controller publishes:
```
#-- See raw data from all tag reads
mosquitto_sub -t rfid/rsp/data/#
#-- See changes in RSP Controller status, e.g., RSP Controller app starts or shuts down
mosquitto_sub -t rfid/rsp/data/#
#-- See the status of all connected RSP sensors
mosquitto_sub -t rfid/rsp/rsp_status/#
```
Full documentation of the MQTT topics and data definitions can be found in the *[Intel® RSP SW Toolkit – RSP Controller Application Interface (API)](https://github.com/intel/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/blob/master/docs/338971-0001_Intel-RSP-SW-Toolkit-Gateway-API.pdf)* guide, chapters 2 and 3.

### Explore the command-line interface
The RSP Controller provides a command line interface (CLI) for configuration and monitoring, available locally on the RSP Controller PC. The CLI is ideal for troubleshooting, simple configuration changes, or a quick check on live data.

1. To connect to the RSP Controller CLI:
```
ssh -p5222 gwconsole@localhost
password: gwconsole
```
![enter image description here](add-screenshot-URL-here)

2. To view summary information about sensors connected to this RSP Controller, enter `view sensor information`:
```
#-- view sensor information 
rfid-gw> sensor show
------------------------------------------
device     connect      reading    behavior  facility    personality  aliases

RSP-150000 CONNECTED    STOPPED    Default   SalesFloor               [RSP-150000-0, RSP-150000-1, RSP-150000-2, RSP-150000-3]
RSP-150004 CONNECTED    STOPPED    Default   SalesFloor  EXIT         [RSP-150004-0, RSP-150004-1, RSP-150004-2, RSP-150004-3]
RSP-150005 CONNECTED    STOPPED    Default   BackStock                [RSP-150005-0, RSP-150005-1, RSP-150005-2, RSP-150005-3]
------------------------------------------
```
Nearly all RFID tag readings are redundant because, for example, retail items sat on the shelf most of the time. The RSP Controller software processes the high volume of readings into useful data, e.g., this one entered, this one moved from here to here, this one exited. 

3. To see a processed summary of inventory (that is, tags read very recently), enter `view inventory summary`.
```
#-- view inventory information
rfid-gw> inventory summary 
------------------------------------------
- Total Tags: 26

- State
      26 PRESENT

- Last Seen
      26 within_last_01_min
------------------------------------------
```
4. To see a list of available commands, at the RSP Controller CLI prompt press Enter with no text.
```
[Show command help terminal output]
```
5. Commands may have several layers of parameters, so the tab completion feature helps. At the RSP Controller CLI prompt type `inventory` and a space character, then press the Tab key.
```
[Show command help terminal output]
```
6. After the CLI displays the available parameters, type `stats` and a space character, then press the Tab key.
```
[Show command help terminal output]
```
7. After the CLI displays the available parameters, type `show` and press Enter.
 ```
[Show command help terminal output]
```
In this way you can see the syntax options progressively without referring to documentation. Full documentation of the CLI is in the *[Intel® RSP SW Toolkit – RSP Controller Installation & User's Guide](https://github.com/intel/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/blob/master/docs/338443-002_Intel-RSP-SW-Toolkit-Gateway.pdf)*, chapter 9.
To view command help, type the command and press Enter.
